# Odin Recipes
This is a Project that I am going to complete and after I am done I will talk about the skills I have learnt through this project

Language used: HTML

I have now finished this projects and I have learnt many skills which include:
* How to use HTML to create a website than can display different recipes with clickable links that takes users to other pages I have made
* Include images onto the webpages I have made which helps them understand what the recipe would look like
* Creating different types of lists(unsorted/sorted lists)
* Determination and resilience as I made sure to finish the project
* I also used Linux the entire time creating files, mvoing directories and deleting them with the Linux Terminal. In combination with that I have also used Git to commit changes which helped me improve my Git SKills

I have however used the inbuilt Co-Pilot to create me an ingredients list and recipe and I have annotated using comments where I have used it
