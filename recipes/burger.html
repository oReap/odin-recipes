        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <!-- instructions list will go here -->
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the ground beef, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Mix gently until just combined; avoid overmixing.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, making a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent puffing during cooking.</li>
            <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill or skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness.</li>
            <li>During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt.</li>
            <li>While the patties are cooking, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Assemble the burgers by placing a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, followed by the cooked patty with melted cheese, a slice of tomato,  a few slices of red onion, and pickles if desired.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with ketchup and mustard to taste, then top with the other half of the bun.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your favorite sides, such as chips or a salad.</li>
